```

### Durable Objects (Phase 7)
- **NotificationHub** — Per-classroom WebSocket connection manager
  - Accepts WebSocket connections from clients
  - Stores active client sessions mapped by userId
  - Broadcasts events to specific users or all classroom members
  - Persists across Worker request/response cycles via hibernation
  - Internal broadcast endpoint: `POST /broadcast` (called by Worker API)

### Type Safety
- Hono exports `AppType` for RPC client type inference in the web app
- Middleware attached to request context: `Variables.userId`

### Key Middleware
- **corsMiddleware** — Handles cross-origin requests
- **authMiddleware** — Extracts and validates Clerk JWT, sets userId
- **errorMiddleware** — Centralized error handling & response formatting

---

## 7. Data Flow

### User Authentication
1. User lands on `/login` → Clerk sign-in widget
2. Clerk JWT issued after successful auth
3. JWT stored in browser (Clerk SDK manages)
4. All API requests include JWT via Authorization header
5. **authMiddleware** validates JWT, extracts Clerk user ID, sets context
6. Clerk webhook syncs user (sign-up/profile changes) to DB

### Assessment Creation & Taking
1. **Teacher creates assessment** → Web form → POST /api/assessments (with questions list)
2. **Teacher assigns to classroom** → Creates post with assessment_id + dueDate
3. **Student sees assignment** → Navigation to take assessment
4. **Assessment taking** → Read-only question view, answer selection, submit
5. **Results** → Scored immediately (if show_results = "immediately"), stored in assessmentAttempts/attemptAnswers
6. **Parent visibility** → Parent dashboard queries child's assessmentAttempts, filtered by parentDetailView config

### Notifications (Phase 7: Real-time via WebSocket)
1. **Event generation** — When comment is posted with @mention or assessment submitted, event created
2. **NotificationHub broadcast** — Worker calls NotificationHub.broadcast() with event + recipients
3. **WebSocket delivery** — All connected clients in classroom receive event in real-time via DO
4. **Notification storage** — Events persisted to notifications table for history/read status
5. **Client handling** — React component receives event → updates query cache → displays toast + increments badge
6. **Read tracking** — User clicks notification → PUT /api/notifications/:id marks as read
7. **Fallback** — GET /api/notifications endpoint for missing history on reconnect

---

## 8. Development Workflow

### Setup
```bash
pnpm install                      # Install all workspace dependencies
pnpm run dev                      # Start API (Wrangler) + Web (Vite) in parallel
pnpm run build                    # Build all apps
pnpm run lint                     # Lint code (turborepo)
pnpm run typecheck                # Type-check all (turborepo)
```

### Local Database
- SQLite during development (Cloudflare D1 in production)
- Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database layer
- Migrations via `drizzle-kit` (not yet configured, phase 1 manual schema setup)

### Code Generation
- Hono RPC client types from AppType export
- Zod runtime validation for API contracts

---

## 9. Security & Auth Strategy

### Dual Authentication (JWT + API Key)
- **Primary (JWT):** Browser-based clients authenticate via Clerk JWT issued on sign-in
- **Fallback (API Key):** Third-party tools (AI agents) authenticate via Clerk API keys from Clerk's backend SDK
- **authMiddleware** (`src/middleware/auth-middleware.ts`) attempts JWT validation first; on failure, validates API key via `@clerk/backend` v3 SDK
- Both flows set `userId`, `authType` ("session"|"api_key"), and `scopes` (string[]) on request context
- **scopeGuard middleware** (`src/middleware/scope-guard-middleware.ts`) enforces scope restrictions for API key tokens (JWT sessions bypass scope checks, using role-based RBAC instead)
- API keys scoped to user, created/managed via `/api/users/api-keys` endpoints

### JWT Validation
- Clerk provides JWT in Authorization header (existing flow)
- **authMiddleware** validates signature using Clerk's JWKS endpoint
- Extracts user ID from JWT claims, sets as request context

### Webhook Verification
- **POST /webhook/clerk** receives user events (created, updated, deleted)
- Verifies webhook signature using Clerk secret
- Syncs user data to `users` table (insert/update/delete)

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- User roles: teacher, student, parent
- API routes enforce role checks (routes return 403 if unauthorized)
- Frontend hides/shows features by role (e.g., "Create Assessment" only for teachers)

### Token Refresh & Error Handling (QA Bugfix)
- **fetchApi** now retries on 401 responses with automatic Clerk token refresh
- Error messages sanitized to prevent leaking sensitive data (tokens, internal paths)
- **Production requirement:** Use Clerk production keys to remove "Development mode" badge

---

## 10. Markdown & Content Rendering

### Question Editor & Preview
- **react-markdown** — Renders markdown in questions and previews
- **remark-gfm** — GitHub-flavored markdown extensions (tables, strikethrough)
- **remark-math** — Math syntax support (LaTeX)
- **rehype-katex** — Renders LaTeX equations (inline & block)
- **rehype-highlight** — Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- **Image embedding** — Questions support embedded images via `/api/upload/image`

### Markdown Support in Questions
- Headings, lists, bold/italic formatting
- Code blocks with language-specific syntax highlighting
- Tables, strikethrough, task lists
- Inline & block LaTeX equations: `$x = y$` and `$$x = y$$`
- Image references: `![alt](image-id)`

---

## 11. Styling & Design System

- **Tailwind CSS v4** with CSS-based config (@theme directives)
- **Design tokens** defined in design-guidelines.md
- **Dark mode** supported (theme toggle in header)
- **Lucide icons** for consistent iconography
